I'm excited to announce that I successfully defended my PhD thesis today. My thesis is entitled, "Collaborative, open, and automated data science," and will be submitted to the MIT Library.

I want to thank the members of my committee, Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni, Prof. Saman Amarasinghe, and Prof. Rob Miller, as well as my colleagues at MIT, friends, and family who were in attendance.

I'm looking forward to taking some much deserved time off and powering down my computer for the first time in a few months.
