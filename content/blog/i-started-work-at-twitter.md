After having earned my PhD earlier this year, I have now started work full time at Twitter as a Machine Learning Engineer. Like many large companies that use ML regularly within their products, Twitter has a dedicated org, [Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/), that builds an internal ML platform for others data scientists to use. I work within this effort on a team that focuses on software frameworks and infrastructure for developing, executing, and orchestrating machine learning pipelines.

I'm excited to be contributing my expertise on ML pipelines (for example, through the [ML Bazaar research project](https://www.micahsmith.com/research/#smith2020machine)) and my insights on the work practices of data scientists in collaborative settings (for example, through the [Ballet](https://www.micahsmith.com/research/#smith2021enabling) and [ATMSeer](https://www.micahsmith.com/research/#wang2019atmseer) research projects). Having spent the past five years in an academic setting (mostly), I'm looking forward to gain deep technical expertise of some of the technologies used in this setting like TensorFlow, TFX, Kubeflow Pipelines, and Google Cloud Platform, and to continuing to grow and develop as an ML engineer.
