I started a new position today at Xyla as Infrastructure Lead and ML Engineer. [Xyla](https://xyla.com) is creating new AI systems for understanding complex knowledge such as clinical medical research and I'm super excited to come onboard. We have a talented and energized team in place and a vision for how the latest generation of large language models and other AI technologies can transform access to knowledge.

For the past year, I was an ML Engineer at Twitter on the [Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/) ML Platform team, building ML pipeline and training infrastructure for large-scale recommender systems. I was privileged to work with exceptional engineers and researchers. Because the Twitter service seems to have a small surface area, some people don't appreciate how much effort it takes to run the business and build new features. I saw first hand how much effort goes in behind the scenes. For example, Twitter's ML models serve over 400 billion predictions online each day (home timelines ranking, ads prediction, NSFW content detection, toxic interactions, etc.) Twitter's engineering orgs maintain a culture of rigor, experimentation, work-life balance, and outsized contribution to open-source software. While it was a year filled with various distractions (cough), I'm proud to have worked there and wish my former colleagues the best!
