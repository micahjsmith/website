I am an ML engineer, researcher, and open-source developer. I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2021 at MIT in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu), where I was advised by Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni in the [Data To AI group](https://dai.lids.mit.edu) within the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu).

Currently, I work as an ML Engineer at Twitter working on machine learning platform, and am also a research affiliate at MIT in the Data to AI Group.

I've helped build and deploy ML models at high-growth startups and have consulted on ML for clients in the finance industry and in academia. Check out my [resume]({static}/files/resume.pdf) or my [full CV]({static}/files/cv.pdf).

My [research]({filename}/pages/research.md) broadly focuses on machine learning, human-computer interaction, and software engineering. How can we create systems that enable people to do machine learning and data science more easily and effectively? How can we make machine learning and data science more collaborative in nature? Can we automate mundane or error-prone tasks in machine learning and data science? How can we make these areas more accessible to other domain experts? How can we expose data science and machine learning to the open-source development paradigm?

[Talk to me]({filename}/pages/contact.md) about research, ML, and software development... as well as biking, public transit, crosswords, BBQ, running, basketball, tennis, fantasy sports, house plants, reading, chess, politics, and more!

You can also [read my blog](/blog) for various musings about the above.
