I am an ML engineer, researcher, and open-source developer. I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2021 at MIT in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu), where I was advised by Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni in the [Data To AI group](https://dai.lids.mit.edu) in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu).

Currently, I am Infrastructure Lead and ML Engineer at [Xyla](https://xyla.com), a startup developing AI systems for understanding complex knowledge such as clinical medical research studies.

I've helped build and deploy ML models at small and large companies and have consulted on ML for clients in the finance industry and in academia. Check out my [resume]({static}/files/resume.pdf) or my [full CV]({static}/files/cv.pdf).

My [research]({filename}/pages/research.md) broadly focuses on machine learning, human-computer interaction, and software engineering. How can we create systems that enable people to do machine learning and data science more easily and effectively? How can we make machine learning and data science more collaborative in nature? Can we automate mundane or error-prone tasks in machine learning and data science? How can we make these areas more accessible to other domain experts? How can we expose data science and machine learning to the open-source development paradigm?

[Talk to me]({filename}/pages/contact.md) about research, ML, and software development... as well as cycling, chess, crosswords, BBQ, running, basketball, tennis, fantasy sports, cooking, house plants, books, trains, and politics...

You can also [read my blog](/blog) for various musings about the above.
