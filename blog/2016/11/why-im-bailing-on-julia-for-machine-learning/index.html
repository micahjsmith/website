  <div>
    <p>I'm bailing on Julia for machine learning — just for my one class, that is. Don't worry
~too much~!</p>
<p>I'm taking graduate machine learning (6.867) this semester at MIT. There are three homework
assignments in the course that are structured as mini-projects, in which students
implement canonical algorithms from scratch and then use them to analyze datasets or
explore the effects of hyperparameters. "Official support" — in the sense of skeleton code,
plotting routines, and TA assistance — is provided for MATLAB and Python only. Working in
Julia (or another language) is allowed, but <em>the going is solo</em>.</p>
<p>After sticking with Julia for the first two assignments, I'm bailing for
the rest of the semester.  Although Julia is great-looking, fun to write, and
performant as ever, there were a lot of challenges I ran into in using existing
functionality within my assignments. Specifically, I found the stats/ML packages pale in
comparison to <code>sklearn</code> in terms of functionality and ease of use. While it was great to use
Julia to implement my own algorithms, it turned out to be a real hassle to tie in with
existing functionality.</p>
<p>As one of several small issues, here's the trouble I went through just to use
pre-existing functionality to fit a logistic regression model.</p>
<h3>Logistic regression case study</h3>
<p>What's the quickest way to fit a logistic regression model for classification? A quick
<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=logistic+regression+julia">search</a> brings up the
<a href="juliastats.github.io">JuliaStats</a> page (as my first result, at least) with a variety of
packages listed. From the descriptions, it seems like our candidates for logistic regression
solvers are <em>GLM.jl</em> and <em>RegERMs.jl.</em> The next search results are for <em>Regression.jl</em> and a
couple DIY logistic regression examples.</p>
<p>Let's assess our options:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GLM.jl</em>: Has most of the goods, but as we'll see, it didn't have all the features I needed
    for my assignment.</li>
<li><em>RegERMs.jl</em>: Doesn't even load on Julia 0.5, last commit over a year ago.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">julia&gt; Pkg.add(&quot;RegERMs&quot;)</span>
<span class="c">ERROR: unsatisfiable package requirements detected: no feasible version could be found</span>
<span class="err">for package: Optim</span>
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li><em>Regression.jl</em>: Doesn't even load on Julia 0.5, last commit over a year ago.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">julia&gt; using Regression</span>
<span class="c">ERROR: LoadError: LoadError: LoadError: UndefVarError: FloatingPoint not defined</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So <em>GLM.jl</em> is our only option. And at this, a new Julia user might be lucky to even find it.
It's not immediate from the JuliaStats blurb that <em>GLM.jl</em> can be used for logistic regression,
and there's no mention of "logistic" neither in the documentation nor in the repo itself
besides a comment in a test case. (An astute user, of course, may note that <code>LogitLink</code> is
relevant, and will likely be aware of the features of the popular R package.)</p>
<p>But it's not too bad to fit a logistic regression model using <em>GLM.jl</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">using GLM, DataFrames</span>
<span class="err">df = DataFrame(x = rand(10,1), y = rand([0,1], 10))</span>
<span class="err">model = fit(GeneralizedLinearModel, y ~ x, df, Binomial(), LogitLink())</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note as well that the DIY logistic regression attempts that rank highly in search results (like
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32703119/logistic-regression-in-julia-using-optim-jl">here</a>
and <a href="http://int8.io/logstic-regression-with-gradient-descent-in-julia/">here</a>) are not super
helpful for the purposes of quickly fitting a model, but are typical of the content that
comes up in results for Julia queries.</p>
<h3>Adding L1/L2 regularization</h3>
<p>In one of the 6.867 assignments, we are asked to apply logistic regression with L1/L2
regularization. <em>GLM.jl</em> doesn't provide this functionality and the other seeming possibilities
were non-functional <em>RegERMs.jl</em>. I was out of luck. I switched to <code>sklearn</code> for the rest of
the problem.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">np</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sklearn.linear_model</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">LogisticRegression</span>
<span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">Y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kp">round</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">LogisticRegression</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">penalty</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;l1&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Y</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After later investigation, I did realize that <em>GLMNet.jl</em>, which wraps the <code>glmnet</code> Fortran library,
would have done the job, with sufficient user effort. </p>
<h3>The pieces are there, the whole is missing</h3>
<p>We were able to fit our logistic regression classifier after a fair amount of digging. But
this digging shouldn't be necessary. It should have been easier to find a logistic
regression <em>that works</em> from the JuliaStats landing page, given that this is a pretty
standard learning algorithm. And inconsistencies within the JuliaStats organization seem to
be a fair problem. A user might start by using <em>GLM.jl</em>. But to add regularization to the
loss function requires to switch to a different package, with a slightly different API so
that the old code can't be dropped in. The
<a href="http://statsbasejl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/statmodels.html">"interface"</a> in StatsBase.jl
isn't totally implemented in some of these more niche packages (<em>GLMNet.jl</em>, <em>Lasso.jl</em>), or isn't
particularly followed at all, especially when the package wraps some underlying library
(<em>LIBSVM.jl</em>).</p>
<p>Then, we have the entirely different entity that is <a href="juliaml.github.io">JuliaML</a>. Here, we
have a design and API that seem to be in direct competition with JuliaStats
(<em>StatsBase.jl</em>/<em>MLBase.jl</em> vs <em>LearnBase.jl</em>, <em>Distances.jl</em> vs <em>LossFunctions.jl</em>,
<em>RegERMs.jl</em> vs <em>MLRisk.jl</em>, etc.). I wasn't sure how to even start using it, let alone
attempt to theoretically combine <em>LossFunctions.jl</em>, <em>StochasticOptimization.jl</em>, and
<em>MLMetrics.jl</em> into something resembling an end-to-end model. I can't quite figure out what
space JuliaML is trying to fit.</p>
<p>Overall, I think that JuliaStats is doing a very good job and is <em>almost there</em>. Packages
like <em>StatsBase.jl</em>, <em>DataFrames.jl</em>, and <em>Distributions.jl</em> are really great to use. Certainly,
the obvious response to the difficulties I had above is that more community support is
needed. Can't argue with that.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Julia has been perfectly suited for quickly coding up ML algorithms from scratch and really
getting my hands dirty. But when I wanted to quickly and easily drop in robust community
packages, I found that the functionality wasn't there.</p>
<p>I'll be using the Python ecosystem for the next assignment, in which we implement neural
nets/backprop. If I find myself having to bust out <code>sklearn</code> more regularly, I better figure
out how to use it fluidly.</p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
