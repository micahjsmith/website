    <p>I made my first crossword! This is something that I've been working on <em>very</em> intermittently
since 2011. Very intermittently, in the sense that I would make progress only when I was
flying across the country on college breaks and, with no any internet connection, sometimes
didn't have anything better to do.</p>
<p><a href="#get-the-puzzle">(Skip to download the puzzle below.)</a></p>
<p>Actually, this is my second puzzle, but my first one is pretty sloppy and I'd rather show
you this one. Maybe that one will see the light one day, maybe not.</p>
<p>This puzzle even has a theme of sorts. See if you can guess which are the theme clues. (I'm
sure you can.) I imagined this printing in the New York Times on Thanksgiving of some year
as I triumphantly waved drumsticks in the air and forced loved ones to solve it.</p>
<h2>Making the puzzle</h2>
<p>It was surprisingly difficult to create the puzzle. I still haven't looked into the
process and resources that experienced creators use, though I'm sure these can ease the
process substantially. In my attempt, I created a 15 x 15 table in iWork Pages/MS Word and
shaded cells to achieve black squares. I would place my theme answers, then try to fill in
corners one at a time. Eventually, I would come to an impasse and have to backtrack, deleting
answers until a fill would be possible again.</p>
<p>At first, all answers came from my head. But if I can't solve every crossword, then surely the
set of answers I could think of was much smaller than those necessary to ensure a diverse
fill. I next resorted to using regex with <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code> (or larger variants). This
was an imperfect solution as dictionaries don't have nearly the phrases, abbreviations,
acronyms, and proper nouns that make for an interesting puzzle. I finally used XWord Info's
excellent <a href="http://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder">clue finder</a> and, in my most active phase, even
shelled out a small donation to get more access. (You may note that by this time I was not
necessarily flying on an airplane.)</p>
<p>This puzzle has seen many iterations. For each, I was my own worst critic, circling my
"groaners" even as friends who play-tested it didn't seem to mind. I minimized these in this
final version the best I can, though I'm sure <a href="http://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/">Rex Parker</a>
would show no mercy on several of my answers.</p>
