  <div>
    <p>At the beginning of 2017, I made a resolution: I would read 17 books for pleasure over the
course of the year. Now, this might seem like very few to my mother who claims to read a new
book every two days on her Kindle. And it might seem like very many for my friends in law school
who read so much from dense textbooks that the thought of reading a lone novel
strikes them with agony. But it was a good target for me.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><a href="https://twitter.com/micahjsmith/status/827249777247125504">Tweet of micahjsmith/827249777247125504</a></blockquote></p>
<p>I also tweeted after each completed book both as a measure of public accountability and as
the beginning of conversations. With just a couple days to spare, I've completed my 17th and
last book of 2017: <em>The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood (James Gleick)</em>. The
challenge has been met. I've really enjoyed getting back into the habit of reading. Over
time, I hope to continue to reach for books instead of my Twitter feed during my downtime as
much as possible.</p>
<p>Consider challenging yourself to read 18 books in 2018!</p>
<h3>Best of the best</h3>
<p>Here are my favorite 5 books of the year. These would be "reviews" if I had remembered to write
down my thoughts for each book soon after I had finished it. For those that I recall only
now, I humbly offer various stream-of-consciousness context and memories.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Namesake (Jhumpa Lahiri)</p>
<p>I remember quite fondly the days from my childhood when I would get so engrossed with a
book that I would have to stay up all night until I had finished it. These books were
often page-turning fantasy novels by my favorite authors, like the Harry Potter and
Discworld series.</p>
<p>I picked up <em>The Namesake</em> at the Harvard Book Store summer warehouse sale. It was the
last book I added to my "shopping cart" (stack in the crook of my left arm) but it made
the cut because in the first few pages, it is revealed that Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli
live in Central Square in Cambridge, only a few blocks away from my apartment last year,
and the former is an engineering student at MIT.</p>
<p>It was when I was visiting Grant Aarons in London in early September that I
started to read <em>The Namesake</em>. Beginning at 10 p.m. one lazy night, I kept reading even after we
all went off to our beds.  Finally, about 4:30 a.m., I turned the last page and closed
the book. I was exhausted from my marathon but invigorated by the story. The humanity of
the characters is striking. Check it out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fates and Furies (Lauren Groff)</p>
<p>A fantastic piece of writing thoughtfully sent my way the lovely Alex Gaspard. On
its face, this
seems like a straightforward story of a fraught relationship between a young couple. But
we peer deep into the hearts of protagonists Lotto and Mathilde, and glimpse the many,
many levels of any relationship.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe, but suffice it to say that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/24/why-the-fates-and-furies-this-years-most-talked-about-novel">President Obama said</a>
"he liked Fates and Furies more than anything else he'd read in 2015" (back in a bygone
era in which presidents read books).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>438 Days: An Extraordinary True Tale of Survival at Sea (Jonathan Franklin)</p>
<p>So... Salvador Alvarenga floated on his small, disabled boat from the west coast of
Mexico all the way across the vast Pacific to a remote part of the Marshall Islands. His
journey lasted 438 days (apparent).</p>
<p>I had heard about this survival story and knew I must read the corresponding book. To
get a sense of the extremeness of this story, you must read it for yourself. But here
are some tidbits. Fighting dehydration, Salvador plucks large sea turtles off the
surface of the ocean with his bare hands, then drinks their blood and eats their
eyeballs. He catches sea birds by standing motionless until they alight on his head,
then grabs them and snaps their necks, eating every part of the bird including feathers.
He is kept alive by his memories of tortillas, which he dreams of every night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The New Jim Crow (Michelle Alexander)</p>
<p>Michelle Alexander makes an extremely powerful and compelling case for the existence of
a new caste system in America. Lower class black and brown people are imprisoned by the
millions as part of the War on Drugs. The imprisonment is just the start — the "felon"
label in the US enables legalized discrimination in housing, employment, federal
benefits, and other areas. If one has a gram of marijuana (or crack) on their person, an
entire system is in place to ensure that they are then under the explicit or implicit
control of the criminal justice system for the rest of their entire lives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this year, efforts to end marijuana prohibition have made significant
progress through the implementation of legalization efforts in California, Nevada,
Massachusetts, and Maine. But at the same time, I regularly see tweets contrasting news
coverage and treatment under the criminal justice system for new white "marijuana
entrepreneurs" and people of color. It is a calamity to watch while marijuana prohibition
slowly fades into the night: white and wealthy people and corporations are beginning to
rapidly cash in on this industry while black and brown people convicted for simple possession
in the past languish in prisons or as members of a permanent legal undercaste for the
rest of their lives. I now believe that future efforts for legalization should be coupled
with explicit proposals to address those who have already been affected by the New Jim Crow
system. I am not familiar with all the legal issues, so I can only
speculate on what these proposals would look like — perhaps convictions could be
expunged and voting rights restored for people convicted of nonviolent marijuana-related
crimes. (Yes, anything related to federal crimes would have to happen at the federal
level, and most of the momentum towards ending marijuana prohibition is at the state level.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Rachel Papers (Martin Amis)</p>
<p>Thanks to Jon Hofman for lending this book to me, which turned out to be quite an
intriguing and enjoyable read. I don't have that much to write here except to reproduce
one of my favorite character descriptions ever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Henry, I now saw, was a very tall, Anglo-Jewish-looking man, with a forehead the size
of a buttock and fat, glistening lips. He wore a trendily cut grey suit, and matching
shirt and tie. To look at him, you'd think he was posh and stupid. In actuality, he
was common and stupid, having obviously trained his loud pompous voice to affect an
upper-class accent while in his twenties (a fixture probably contemporaneous with
'Seth -'). Thirty years on, he had just as obviously forgotten it. Luckily he was too
smug to notice his twanging 'eows' and 'ois'. Old Harry had a strange figure, but
quite symmetrical really. From ankle to knee he was thin. From knee to thigh he was
fat.  From thigh to waist he was very fat. From From waist to ribs he was very very
fat. From ribs to shoulder he was very fat. He had a fat neck. His face, apart from
his watermelon lips, was thin."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Honorable mentions: If On A Winter's Night A Traveller (Italo Calvino), The Circle (Dave
Eggers), The Commanders (Bob Woodward).</p>
<h3>The full list</h3>
<p>The full list includes 11 fiction and 6 non-fiction. It sources books from the back of my
bookshelf, the Harvard Bookstore summer warehouse sale, the collections of various friends,
and other misc. sources. Most of these books were not <em>written</em> this year — perhaps next
year I'll focus on buying 2018 books to be able to join the conversation more
contemporaneously.</p>
